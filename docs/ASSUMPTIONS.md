# Assumptions

This project is a **portfolio-safe simulation**, not an operational system.

---

## Operational Assumptions

- No classified inputs
- No real-world targeting
- No weapon employment logic
- Human-in-the-loop decisions only

---

## Technical Assumptions

- Stateless services
- In-memory state resets on restart
- JWT shared secret (demo only)
- Single-region deployment

---

## Demo Assumptions

- Scenario buttons simulate sensor input
- Coordinates are randomized within bounded ranges
- Threat scoring is illustrative, not predictive
